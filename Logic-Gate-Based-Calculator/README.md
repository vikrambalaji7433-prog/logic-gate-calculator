🧠 Logic Gate Based Calculator

The Logic Gate Based Calculator is an innovative web-based project that performs fundamental arithmetic and logical operations using the core principles of digital logic design.
Unlike traditional calculators that depend on built-in arithmetic operators, this project simulates how a computer’s CPU processes data at the gate level, making it both educational and fascinating for anyone interested in computer architecture, digital electronics, or logic circuit design.

⚙️ How It Works

At the heart of this calculator lies a collection of virtual logic gates —
AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, and NOR.
Each mathematical or logical operation is broken down into smaller logical steps, combining these gates to reproduce the way real-world processors perform computations.

For example:

Addition is implemented using half adders and full adders built from XOR and AND gates.

Subtraction uses the concept of two’s complement with inverters (NOT gates).

Logical operations such as AND, OR, and XOR are simulated directly through gate-level logic.

💻 Features

Simulates digital logic operations at the gate level.

Performs basic arithmetic (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division).

Includes logical operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, NAND, NOR).

Interactive web interface built for visualization and experimentation.

🧩 Educational Purpose

This project bridges the gap between theory and practice by demonstrating how basic logic gates combine to perform complex operations.
It’s not just a calculator — it’s a learning model that lets you see how computers think at the most fundamental level.
